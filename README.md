## 🩲 Trunk-Based Development (Branching Model)

This project is based on a source-control branching model, where collaboration on code is bundled in a single branch called ‘trunk’ (dev).
Read more about [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

## 🥒 Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD lets you write system requirements in plain language that everyone can understand. Feature files use Gherkin syntax, a simple, structured format that reads like natural English.
Because user stories and use cases share this structure, feature files serve dual purposes: they help stakeholders grasp user flows and scenarios while simultaneously powering your automated test suite.
