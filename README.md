## 🩲 Trunk-Based Development (Branching Model)

This project is based on a source-control branching model, where collaboration on code is bundled in a single branch called ‘trunk’ (dev).
Read more about trunk-based development [here](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

## 🥒 Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

In BDD you write your system requirements in structural but natural language. Writing end-to-end tests in natural language enlarges the audience that can read and use them.
Basic .feature files are written with [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) syntax. User stories (and even use cases) are based on a similar structure and therefore .feature files won't only help stakeholders to better understand specific user flows or scenarios, they can also be used as a skeleton for automated tests (e.g. e2e tests).
