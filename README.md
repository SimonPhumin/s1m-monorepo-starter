# s1m-monorepo-starter

This is my current monorepo setup including two micro-front ends built with angular.

## Ideas

I've always wanted to provide a go to starter kit on how to develop front ends in an agile process. This is still a work in progress.

### Trunk-Based Development

This project is based on a source-control branching model, where collaboration on code is bundled in a single branch called ‘trunk’ (dev).
Read more about trunk-based development [here](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

### (BDD) Behavior-Driven Development

In BDD you write your system requirements in structural but natural language. Writing End-to-End tests in a natural language enlarges the audience that can read and use them.
I've been a big fan of writing .feature files with the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) syntax. User stories are based on a similar approach and therefore .feature files not only help stakeholders to better understand specific user flows or scenarios, they are also used as a skeleton for automated tests.

## Features

➡️ [Nx](https://nx.dev/) - monorepo tooling  
➡️ [Angular 13](https://angular.io/) - front-end  
➡️ [NGRX](https://ngrx.io/) - reactive state management  
➡️ [NestJS 8](https://nestjs.com/) - api  
➡️ [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - unit testing  
https://cucumber.io/
➡️ [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - e2e testing  
➡️ [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - code linting  
➡️ [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - code formatting
