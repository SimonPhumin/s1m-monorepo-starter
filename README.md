## Trunk-Based Development (Branching Model)

This project is based on a source-control branching model, where collaboration on code is bundled in a single branch called ‘trunk’ (dev).
Read more about trunk-based development [here](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

In BDD you write your system requirements in structural but natural language. Writing end-to-end tests in a natural language enlarges the audience that can read and use them.
I've been a big fan of writing .feature files with the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) syntax. User stories are based on a similar approach and therefore .feature files not only help stakeholders to better understand specific user flows or scenarios, they can also be used as a skeleton for automated tests.
